# Video Games
An introduction to computer science fundamentals through video games.

## Game Example

This lesson challenges the beginner student of computer science to design a game like the [Monkey Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/86080676/). 

## Challenge

We are halfway through creating a new game, but we couldn’t finish it - help us fix these issues! To get started, navigate to the [MIT Scratch code for the unfinished game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/185666223/). 

Then, try to solve the following:

1. There is a sprite chasing you, but you can’t move!
2. You are supposed to collect bananas to score points, but they don’t give you anything right now!
3. The bananas don’t move to a new location after you find them!
4. The costume of the monkey and banana are missing! (Make these whatever you want)
5. The background is missing! (Make this whatever you want)
