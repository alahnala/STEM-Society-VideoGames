# Video Games
An introduction to computer science fundamentals through video games.

## Game Example

This lesson challenges the beginner student of computer science to design a game like the [Monkey Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/86080676/). 

## Challenge

We are halfway through creating a new game, but we couldn’t finish it - help us fix these issues! To get started, navigate to the [MIT Scratch code for the unfinished game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/185666223/). 

Then, try to solve the following:

1. There is a sprite chasing you, but you can’t move!
2. You are supposed to collect bananas to score points, but they don’t give you anything right now!
3. The bananas don’t move to a new location after you find them!
4. The costume of the monkey and banana are missing! (Make these whatever you want)
5. The background is missing! (Make this whatever you want)

## Credits

This lesson was created by Allie Lahnala (me) and Tom Sandell in the Fall of 2015 as part of our involvement with STEM Society, a student-run organization at University of Michigan. The lesson has undergone minor incremental updates each year, with contributions from Travis DePrato, Paul Chamberlain, and Humza Khan after my graduation 2017. If you are aware of additional contributors, please reach out to me so I can credit them as well.
